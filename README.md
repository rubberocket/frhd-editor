# frhd-editor

The source code for the FRHD offline editor available on the Chrome Web Store. The version in this repo is slightly different because I expanded the code in the scripts folder.

# Interesting things I found while looking through the code

If you go to the settings.js file (i expanded it for you already) you can change some textures like the hat and head models that are hosted on cdn.kanohub.com
